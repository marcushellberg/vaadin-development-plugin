  Guide Claude on structuring Vaadin 25 Flow views into focused, reusable components.
  This skill should be used when the user asks to "structure a view", "organize view code",
  "break down a complex view", "extract a component", "split a view into components",
  "simplify a large view", "create a reusable component", "use Composite",
  "compose components", or when a view is growing beyond ~200 lines,
  has multiple logical sections, or contains repeated UI patterns.

# Structuring Views into Components in Vaadin 25

Use the Vaadin MCP tools (`search_vaadin_docs`, `get_component_java_api`) to look up the latest documentation whenever uncertain about a specific API detail. Always set `vaadin_version` to `"25"` and `ui_language` to `"java"`.

## When to Extract Components

Not every view needs decomposition. Extract when you see these signals:

- **View exceeds ~200 lines** — hard to navigate and reason about
- **Cohesive groups** — a cluster of components that form a logical unit (e.g., a filter bar, a detail panel)
- **Repeated patterns** — the same group of components appears in multiple views
- **Isolated state** — a section manages its own state independently from the rest of the view

### Before and After

A monolithic `OrderView` with filters, a grid, and a detail panel all in one class:

```java
// BEFORE: everything in one 300-line view
public class OrderView extends Composite<VerticalLayout> {
    // 15 filter fields, grid setup, detail panel, all interleaved...
}

// AFTER: decomposed into focused components
public class OrderView extends Composite<VerticalLayout> {

    private final OrderFilterBar filterBar = new OrderFilterBar();
    private final Grid<Order> grid = new Grid<>(Order.class);
    private final OrderDetailPanel detailPanel = new OrderDetailPanel();

    public OrderView(OrderService service) {
        filterBar.addFilterChangeListener(e -> refreshGrid(service, e.getFilter()));
        grid.asSingleSelect().addValueChangeListener(e -> detailPanel.setOrder(e.getValue()));
        getContent().add(filterBar, grid, detailPanel);
    }
}
```

Each extracted component owns its own layout and state; the view wires them together.

## The Extraction Workflow

1. **Identify cohesive groups** — look for clusters of fields, buttons, or layouts that serve one purpose.
2. **Define the boundary** — what does the component own (internal state, layout) vs. what does it need from outside (data, configuration)?
3. **Choose the right base** — use `Composite<T>` by default. Extend an existing component only when you want its full API. Use `AbstractField<C, V>` when the component represents an editable value for Binder. See the next section for details.
4. **Extract and wire up** — move the component's fields and layout code into its own class. Pass required data through constructors or setters.
5. **Connect parent and child** — use method calls for parent→child communication, custom events for child→parent. See "Wiring Communication" below.

## Choosing the Right Base: Composite vs. Extend

When extracting a view section into its own component, you need to choose a base class. Lead with `Composite<T>` — it's the right choice in most cases.

### Composite<T> (recommended default)

Use when you want to **hide** the root component's API and expose only what you explicitly define. `Composite<T>` wraps a root component and makes `getContent()` protected, so users can only interact through your public methods.

```java
public class UserCard extends Composite<HorizontalLayout> {

    private final Avatar avatar = new Avatar();
    private final Span name = new Span();
    private final Span role = new Span();

    public UserCard() {
        VerticalLayout info = new VerticalLayout(name, role);
        info.setSpacing(false);
        info.setPadding(false);

        getContent().setAlignItems(FlexComponent.Alignment.CENTER);
        getContent().add(avatar, info);
    }

    public void setUser(String userName, String userRole, String imageUrl) {
        name.setText(userName);
        role.setText(userRole);
        avatar.setImage(imageUrl);
        avatar.setName(userName);
    }
}
```

Good for: compound components, encapsulated UI blocks, extracted view sections.

### Extend an existing component

Use when you want to **add** to an existing component's API. The parent class's full public API remains accessible.

```java
public class PrimaryButton extends Button {
    public PrimaryButton(String text) {
        super(text);
        addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY); // LUMO_PRIMARY for Lumo, AURA_PRIMARY for Aura
    }
}
```

Good for: pre-configured variants, adding convenience methods, specializing behavior.

Risk: every public method on the parent is part of your API. Users can call anything on Button, which may break your component's invariants.

**Prefer Composite for new components.** It produces cleaner APIs and prevents accidental misuse. See the reference file for the full decision matrix.

## Defining the Component's API

### Principles

1. **Expose intent, not implementation** — public methods should describe what the component does, not how it's built. `setUser(name, role)` is better than exposing the internal `Span` and `Avatar`.

2. **Make invalid states unrepresentable** — if your component requires both a title and an icon, take them as constructor parameters rather than offering separate setters that can be called in any order.

3. **Follow Vaadin conventions** — users expect familiar patterns:
   - `setValue()` / `getValue()` for components with a value
   - `setLabel()` for field labels
   - `setEnabled()` / `setReadOnly()` for interaction states
   - `addXxxListener()` for events

4. **Use typed events** — define custom `ComponentEvent` subclasses instead of generic callbacks. This integrates with Vaadin's event system and supports `@DomEvent` for client-side events.

### Constructor Design

Provide a no-arg constructor for compatibility with Vaadin's declarative systems, then offer convenience constructors for common usage:

```java
public class StatusBadge extends Composite<Span> {

    public StatusBadge() {
        // default state
    }

    public StatusBadge(Status status) {
        setStatus(status);
    }

    public void setStatus(Status status) {
        getContent().setText(status.getLabel());
        getContent().getElement().getThemeList().clear();
        getContent().getElement().getThemeList().add("badge " + status.getTheme());
    }
}
```

## Wiring Communication Between Components

When a view is split into parent and child components, they need to communicate. Use the right pattern for the direction.

### Parent → Child: method calls

The parent holds a reference to the child and calls its public methods directly:

```java
// In the parent view
detailPanel.setOrder(selectedOrder);
filterBar.reset();
```

### Child → Parent: custom events

Children should not know about their parent. Fire a typed event and let the parent listen:

```java
public class OrderFilterBar extends Composite<HorizontalLayout> {

    public Registration addFilterChangeListener(
            ComponentEventListener<FilterChangeEvent> listener) {
        return addListener(FilterChangeEvent.class, listener);
    }

    private void onFilterChanged() {
        fireEvent(new FilterChangeEvent(this, false, buildFilter()));
    }

    public static class FilterChangeEvent extends ComponentEvent<OrderFilterBar> {
        private final OrderFilter filter;

        public FilterChangeEvent(OrderFilterBar source, boolean fromClient,
                OrderFilter filter) {
            super(source, fromClient);
            this.filter = filter;
        }

        public OrderFilter getFilter() {
            return filter;
        }
    }
}
```

### Wrapper with Slots

A common pattern for layout-style components with named areas:

```java
public class PageHeader extends Composite<HorizontalLayout> {

    private final Div titleSlot = new Div();
    private final Div actionsSlot = new Div();

    public PageHeader() {
        getContent().setWidthFull();
        getContent().setAlignItems(FlexComponent.Alignment.CENTER);
        getContent().setJustifyContentMode(FlexComponent.JustifyContentMode.BETWEEN);
        getContent().add(titleSlot, actionsSlot);
    }

    public void setTitle(String title) {
        titleSlot.removeAll();
        titleSlot.add(new H2(title));
    }

    public void setActions(Component... actions) {
        actionsSlot.removeAll();
        HorizontalLayout actionBar = new HorizontalLayout(actions);
        actionsSlot.add(actionBar);
    }
}
```

## Lifecycle Considerations

- **onAttach()** — called when the component is added to the UI. Use for initialization that requires the component to be in the DOM (e.g., accessing session data, subscribing to event buses).
- **onDetach()** — called before removal from the UI. Use for cleanup (e.g., unsubscribing from event buses, releasing resources).
- Always clean up in `onDetach()` what you set up in `onAttach()` to prevent memory leaks.

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the view, extract when needed** — don't pre-optimize. Build the view first, then extract when signals appear (see "When to Extract Components").
2. **Prefer Composite over direct extension** — it gives you API control and prevents leaking internals.
3. **Keep components focused** — a component should do one thing well. If it has too many responsibilities, split it.
4. **Use typed events for child→parent communication** — `addXxxListener()` returning `Registration` is the Vaadin way.
5. **Don't expose internal components** — return data from getters, not the underlying Spans and Divs.
6. **Test extracted components in isolation** — reusable components should be testable with Vaadin's UI unit testing framework without needing a full application context.
